# Retail-Sales-Analysis-SQL

Project Description
This data analytics project focuses on using SQL to answer key business questions and uncover insights from a sales transaction dataset. The analysis involves writing specific SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data, providing valuable information that can drive business decisions.

Data Analysis & Business Key Problems
The project addresses the following business problems:

Sales on a Specific Date:

Question: Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05'.
Purpose: Identify and analyze the sales transactions that occurred on a specific day.
Clothing Sales in November 2022:

Question: Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 10 in the month of November 2022.
Purpose: Focus on high-volume clothing sales during a particular month to identify trends or demand spikes.
Total Sales by Category:

Question: Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.
Purpose: Understand which product categories are generating the most revenue.
Average Age of Beauty Category Customers:

Question: Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
Purpose: Determine the average customer age for a specific product category, which could inform marketing strategies.
High-Value Transactions:

Question: Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.
Purpose: Identify significant sales transactions that may warrant special attention or analysis.
Transactions by Gender and Category:

Question: Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.
Purpose: Explore purchasing patterns across different genders and product categories.
Average Monthly Sales & Best Selling Month:

Question: Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Additionally, identify the best-selling month in each year.
Purpose: Analyze monthly sales performance and recognize peak sales periods.
Top 5 Customers by Total Sales:

Question: Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales.
Purpose: Identify the most valuable customers, which could be useful for loyalty programs or targeted marketing.
Unique Customers by Category:

Question: Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.
Purpose: Measure the diversity of customer interest across different product categories.
Orders by Shift:

Question: Write a SQL query to create each shift and the number of orders (e.g., Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17).
Purpose: Understand the distribution of orders throughout the day, which can inform staffing and operational decisions.
My Analysis & Findings
In this project, I developed SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. Each query addresses a specific business problem, and the results provide actionable information that can help in making informed business decisions. The queries are designed to be efficient and to handle large datasets typical of retail and sales environments.

This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing the SQL skills essential for data analyst roles. If you have any questions, feedback, or would like to collaborate, feel free to get in touch!
